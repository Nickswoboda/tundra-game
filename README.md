# Tundra
Tundra is a Pac-Man inspired arcade game. Play as Bruce the seal and try to catch fish while being chased by Brutus the polar bear and Bjorn the grizzly. The objective is to catch all of the fish before being caught by the bears. But be careful, once you start moving on ice, you are unable to change directions until you hit another patch of ground.

Tundra has been created as a sandbox to test and guide the development of the [Aegis game development library](https://github.com/nickswoboda/Aegis).
